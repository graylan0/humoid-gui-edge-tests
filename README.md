Certainly! Writing documentation for your API is crucial for both internal use and if you plan to expose the API to other developers. Below is a simple documentation template for your FastAPI application. This documentation assumes the FastAPI server you've set up is used for processing text with the `llama_generate` function and includes API key authentication.

# FastAPI Llama Generate API Documentation

## Overview

The Llama Generate API provides an interface for processing text inputs using the `llama_generate` function. It's built using FastAPI and requires an API key for authentication.

## Base URL

The base URL for the API is:

```
https://yourngorkhere
```

## Authentication

Requests to the API must be authenticated using an API key. The key should be included in the request header:

```
access_token: YOUR_API_KEY
```

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key.

## Endpoints

### POST /process/

This endpoint processes the given text input and returns a response.

#### Request

**URL**: `/process/`

**Method**: `POST`

**Headers**:

- `Content-Type`: `application/json`
- `access_token`: `YOUR_API_KEY`

**Body**:

```json
{
    "message": "Your input text here"
}
```

#### Response

**Success Response Code**: `200 OK`

**Content**:

```json
{
    "response": "Processed text response"
}
```

**Error Response**:

- **Code**: `403 Forbidden` - Invalid API key
- **Code**: `500 Internal Server Error` - Server processing error

#### Example

```bash
curl -X POST "https://magnetic-poodle-apparent.ngrok-free.app/process/" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "access_token: YOUR_API_KEY" \
     -d '{"message":"Hello, world!"}'
```

## Error Codes

The API uses the following error codes:

- `200 OK`: The request was successful.
- `403 Forbidden`: The API key is invalid.
- `500 Internal Server Error`: There was an error processing the request on the server.

## Rate Limiting

[Include information about rate limiting if applicable.]

This template provides a basic structure for your API documentation, including an overview, authentication details, endpoint descriptions, and example requests. You should expand on each section based on the specifics of your API and its usage. If your API is publicly accessible, consider using tools like Swagger UI (which FastAPI supports) for interactive documentation.
